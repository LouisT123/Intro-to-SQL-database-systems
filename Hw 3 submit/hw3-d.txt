I would say that a cloud based DBMS is a bit nicer than the SQLite that we've been previously using.
It has advantages such as: a query runtime displayed in seconds, color coding is nice, and the database is easy to access and lighter on your system since its run on Microsoft's servers.
Overall I would recommend it but the one downside I can think of is it needing an internet connection comapred to a database stored on your own system.
